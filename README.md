This is a simple React project built with Vite. I created this project as part of React course on Udemy by John Smilga. It serves as a practice exercise for utilizing the useState hook in React.

## Project Description

In this project, I've implemented a straightforward birthday reminder app. The main feature of the app is to display a list of people who have their birthdays today. The user can see a person's name and their age. To clear the entire list, there's a "Clear All" button at the bottom of the list.

## Technologies Used
